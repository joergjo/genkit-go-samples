# Tools Sample

## About
This sample demonstrates Genkit Go's tool calling capabilities based on a fictitious home automation scenario. 

This sample is inspired by a C# sample from the book [_Building AI Applications with Microsoft Semantic Kernel_](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/building-ai-applications-with-microsoft-semantic-kernel-9781835469590). The original C# source code can be found [here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-AI-Applications-with-Microsoft-Semantic-Kernel/tree/main/dotnet/ch5/ch5_home).   

## Running the Sample
```bash
cd tools
export GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
go run .
```
